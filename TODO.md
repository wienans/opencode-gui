- [x] Opencode extension seem to open in MacOS filesystem root, not the workspace that the VSCode opens in
  - **Status**: Fixed by temporarily changing working directory during server spawn
  - **Details**: Modified `OpenCodeService.ts` to use `process.chdir()` to the workspace root before calling `createOpencode()`, then immediately restoring the original cwd. This ensures the spawned OpenCode server inherits the correct working directory for project context discovery.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/filesystem-root-issue.md](docs/todos/filesystem-root-issue.md)
- [x] Style improvements: Remove send button and text drag handle. Make the text editor focus outline blue. Add a small button with text ⌘⏎ in the bottom right of the textbox with quiet styling. When either clicked or cmd-enter is pressed, the prompt should be submitted.

  - **Status**: Completed - all style improvements implemented successfully
  - **Details**: Removed send button, disabled textarea resize handle, added blue focus outline (#007ACC), added quiet ⌘⏎ button in bottom-right corner, and wired up Cmd+Enter keyboard shortcut for submission
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/style-improvements-send-button.md](docs/todos/style-improvements-send-button.md)

- [x] More style improvements: Right now, the prompt box is always at the top, and the conversation shows up as message bubbles underneath. When there's no conversation yet, I want the prompt editor to show up at the top with the current style. After a prompt is submitted, the prompt editor should move to the bottom. The style of the messages should also change. A user message should be styled like the prompt editor (full width, same background, padding, slight border). An assistant message should have no styling: that is, it should write into the surface of the extension, and take up the full width as well. Thinking blocks should be in toggle blocks.

  - **Status**: Completed - all layout and message styling improvements implemented
  - **Details**: Prompt editor now repositions from top to bottom after first message. User messages styled like prompt editor (full width, input background, border). Assistant messages have transparent background and blend into surface. Thinking indicators implemented as collapsible `<details>` blocks.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/style-improvements-layout.md](docs/todos/style-improvements-layout.md)

- [x] Check to make sure is it using the Opencode config in the workspace?

  - **Status**: Completed - workspace config loading verified and enhanced with logging
  - **Details**: Added comprehensive logging to show when workspace `opencode.json` is loaded, what values are in it, and verification that the config was successfully applied to the OpenCode server. Added `verifyConfig()` method that queries the server's active config and compares it to the workspace config to ensure settings match.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/opencode-config-verification.md](docs/todos/opencode-config-verification.md)

- [x] Prompt editor should auto-resize as user types

  - **Status**: Completed - prompt editor textarea now auto-resizes smoothly as content is added
  - **Details**: Implemented JavaScript-based auto-resize that expands the textarea height from 36px minimum up to 120px maximum (about 5-6 lines). Added overflow scrolling when content exceeds max height. Works by measuring scrollHeight and dynamically updating the height style on input changes.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/prompt-editor-auto-resize.md](docs/todos/prompt-editor-auto-resize.md)

- [x] Tool calls should show up. Can it even make tool calls right now?

  - **Status**: Completed - tool calls now display as collapsible blocks with status, input, output, and error information
  - **Details**: Implemented comprehensive support for displaying all OpenCode message part types including tool calls, reasoning blocks, and text parts. The UI now shows tool calls with status badges (pending/running/completed/error), formatted input parameters, output results, and error messages. Also added support for reasoning blocks. Maintains backward compatibility with text-only messages.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/tool-calls.md](docs/todos/tool-calls.md)

- [x] Implement SSE streaming so we can get real tool call support. See [docs/todos/tool-calls.md](docs/todos/tool-calls.md). Would RivetKit be helpful here? https://www.rivet.dev/docs/actors/ Consider adding.

  - **Status**: Completed - SSE streaming fully implemented for real-time tool call and message updates
  - **Details**: Implemented complete SSE streaming using OpenCode SDK's built-in `event.subscribe()` method. Added `sendPromptStreaming()` to OpenCodeService that subscribes to SSE events, filters by sessionID, and streams real-time updates to the UI. Updated OpenCodeViewProvider to handle streaming events (`message.part.updated`, `message.updated`, `session.idle`). Modified React app to handle streaming part updates with proper state management. RivetKit evaluation: not needed - OpenCode SDK has comprehensive SSE support already built-in.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/sse-streaming.md](docs/todos/sse-streaming.md)
  - **What Works**: Real-time tool call visibility (pending → running → completed), text streaming with deltas, reasoning blocks, proper session isolation, error handling and cleanup
  - **Testing Needed**: The implementation is complete and builds successfully, but needs real-world testing with prompts that trigger tool calls to verify the streaming behavior works as expected

- [ ] Rewrite in Solidjs
- [ ] Agent switcher - add a little button to the left of the send button in the prompt editor that when clicked lets us toggle between different agents. Also, it seems like the send-message button is just absolutely positioned. Let's add extra space to the bottom of the editor to make space for both of the send message button and the agent switcher. The send message button should be secondary style, and agent switcher should be quiet style.
- [ ] Style improvements: let's lower the horizontal paddings on all the messages, remove the placeholder message on the prompt editor as well as the intro help message. There's also like a "Chat" section heading on the extension. Does that need to be there? Can we get rid of that.
- [ ] Markdown support in assistant messages
- [ ] @-mention support
- [ ] New session button
- [ ] Session switcher
