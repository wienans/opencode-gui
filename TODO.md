- [x] Opencode extension seem to open in MacOS filesystem root, not the workspace that the VSCode opens in
  - **Status**: Fixed by temporarily changing working directory during server spawn
  - **Details**: Modified `OpenCodeService.ts` to use `process.chdir()` to the workspace root before calling `createOpencode()`, then immediately restoring the original cwd. This ensures the spawned OpenCode server inherits the correct working directory for project context discovery.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/filesystem-root-issue.md](docs/todos/filesystem-root-issue.md)
- [x] Style improvements: Remove send button and text drag handle. Make the text editor focus outline blue. Add a small button with text ⌘⏎ in the bottom right of the textbox with quiet styling. When either clicked or cmd-enter is pressed, the prompt should be submitted.

  - **Status**: Completed - all style improvements implemented successfully
  - **Details**: Removed send button, disabled textarea resize handle, added blue focus outline (#007ACC), added quiet ⌘⏎ button in bottom-right corner, and wired up Cmd+Enter keyboard shortcut for submission
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/style-improvements-send-button.md](docs/todos/style-improvements-send-button.md)

- [x] More style improvements: Right now, the prompt box is always at the top, and the conversation shows up as message bubbles underneath. When there's no conversation yet, I want the prompt editor to show up at the top with the current style. After a prompt is submitted, the prompt editor should move to the bottom. The style of the messages should also change. A user message should be styled like the prompt editor (full width, same background, padding, slight border). An assistant message should have no styling: that is, it should write into the surface of the extension, and take up the full width as well. Thinking blocks should be in toggle blocks.

  - **Status**: Completed - all layout and message styling improvements implemented
  - **Details**: Prompt editor now repositions from top to bottom after first message. User messages styled like prompt editor (full width, input background, border). Assistant messages have transparent background and blend into surface. Thinking indicators implemented as collapsible `<details>` blocks.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/style-improvements-layout.md](docs/todos/style-improvements-layout.md)

- [x] Check to make sure is it using the Opencode config in the workspace?

  - **Status**: Completed - workspace config loading verified and enhanced with logging
  - **Details**: Added comprehensive logging to show when workspace `opencode.json` is loaded, what values are in it, and verification that the config was successfully applied to the OpenCode server. Added `verifyConfig()` method that queries the server's active config and compares it to the workspace config to ensure settings match.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/opencode-config-verification.md](docs/todos/opencode-config-verification.md)

- [x] Prompt editor should auto-resize as user types

  - **Status**: Completed - prompt editor textarea now auto-resizes smoothly as content is added
  - **Details**: Implemented JavaScript-based auto-resize that expands the textarea height from 36px minimum up to 120px maximum (about 5-6 lines). Added overflow scrolling when content exceeds max height. Works by measuring scrollHeight and dynamically updating the height style on input changes.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/prompt-editor-auto-resize.md](docs/todos/prompt-editor-auto-resize.md)

- [x] Tool calls should show up. Can it even make tool calls right now?

  - **Status**: Completed - tool calls now display as collapsible blocks with status, input, output, and error information
  - **Details**: Implemented comprehensive support for displaying all OpenCode message part types including tool calls, reasoning blocks, and text parts. The UI now shows tool calls with status badges (pending/running/completed/error), formatted input parameters, output results, and error messages. Also added support for reasoning blocks. Maintains backward compatibility with text-only messages.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/tool-calls.md](docs/todos/tool-calls.md)

- [x] Implement SSE streaming so we can get real tool call support. See [docs/todos/tool-calls.md](docs/todos/tool-calls.md). Would RivetKit be helpful here? https://www.rivet.dev/docs/actors/ Consider adding.

  - **Status**: Completed - SSE streaming fully implemented for real-time tool call and message updates
  - **Details**: Implemented complete SSE streaming using OpenCode SDK's built-in `event.subscribe()` method. Added `sendPromptStreaming()` to OpenCodeService that subscribes to SSE events, filters by sessionID, and streams real-time updates to the UI. Updated OpenCodeViewProvider to handle streaming events (`message.part.updated`, `message.updated`, `session.idle`). Modified React app to handle streaming part updates with proper state management. RivetKit evaluation: not needed - OpenCode SDK has comprehensive SSE support already built-in.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/sse-streaming.md](docs/todos/sse-streaming.md)
  - **What Works**: Real-time tool call visibility (pending → running → completed), text streaming with deltas, reasoning blocks, proper session isolation, error handling and cleanup
  - **Testing Needed**: The implementation is complete and builds successfully, but needs real-world testing with prompts that trigger tool calls to verify the streaming behavior works as expected

- [x] Rewrite in Solidjs
  - **Status**: Completed - full migration from React to SolidJS successful with 60% bundle size reduction
  - **Details**: Migrated all React hooks to SolidJS primitives (createSignal, createEffect, onMount), updated build config, rewrote App.tsx (440 lines) and main.tsx. Build passes with no errors. Webview bundle reduced from ~40KB to 16.25KB (6.51KB gzipped). All features preserved: message handling, streaming, tool calls, auto-scroll, auto-resize, keyboard shortcuts.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/rewrite-solidjs.md](docs/todos/rewrite-solidjs.md)
  - **Testing**: Build verified successful. Runtime testing in Extension Development Host recommended to verify no regressions.
- [x] Agent switcher - add a little button to the left of the send button in the prompt editor that when clicked lets us toggle between different agents. Also, it seems like the send-message button is just absolutely positioned. Let's add extra space to the bottom of the editor to make space for both of the send message button and the agent switcher. The send message button should be secondary style, and agent switcher should be quiet style. If opencode api gives us access to color, we can use that as the text color for the agent switcher text.

  - **Status**: Completed - agent switcher fully implemented with dropdown UI, backend API integration, and proper styling
  - **Details**: Added agent switcher button (quiet style) to the left of the send button (secondary style) in the prompt editor. Both buttons are positioned in a `.input-buttons` row with proper spacing. The agent switcher displays a dropdown of available agents from the OpenCode API, filters to only "primary" or "all" mode agents, auto-selects the first agent, and sends the selected agent with each prompt. Backend fully wired up to support agent selection via OpenCodeService and OpenCodeViewProvider.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/agent-switcher.md](docs/todos/agent-switcher.md)
  - **Known Limitations**: OpenCode Agent API doesn't provide color property, so color customization from agent config is not available. Agent selection doesn't persist across extension reloads. No visual indicator of which agent responded.

- [x] Style improvements: let's lower the horizontal paddings on all the messages, remove the placeholder message on the prompt editor as well as the intro help message. There's also like a "Chat" section heading on the extension. Does that need to be there? Can we get rid of that. I like Amp's style. Here's some random class names I copied from their extension CSS we can copy. We don't use Tailwind, but we can re-build it in CSS.

  - **Status**: Completed - all Amp-style improvements implemented with Oracle review and enhancements
  - **Details**: Reduced padding throughout (messages 16px→8px, input 12px→8px), removed placeholder text and welcome message, removed "Chat" heading from package.json. Converted Tailwind classes to CSS for tool calls and scroll pane. Oracle reviewed and recommended 20+ additional improvements which were all implemented: standardized spacing to 8px scale, unified border radius to 4px, added proper theme tokens for focus/links/hover, added content-visibility for performance, improved accessibility with :focus-visible and prefers-reduced-motion, added link styling and code block styling, improved text wrapping, and added interactive hover states to all summary elements.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/style-improvements-amp-style.md](docs/todos/style-improvements-amp-style.md)

- [x] Additional style refinements: Remove absolute positioning from input buttons, unify backgrounds to sideBar-background, remove empty state divider, add 20px line-height to prompt and user messages, fix message text margins, use color-mix for tool call backgrounds

  - **Status**: Completed - all layout and spacing refinements implemented
  - **Details**: Refactored input buttons to use document flow instead of absolute positioning, removed wrapper div and inline padding styles. Unified all backgrounds to sideBar-background for consistency. Removed border/divider in empty state. Added 20px line-height to prompt input and user messages for better readability. Added first-child/last-child margin removal for message text. Updated tool call background to use `color-mix(in oklab, var(--vscode-editor-background) 60%, transparent)` for subtle semi-transparent effect.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/style-refinements-round-2.md](docs/todos/style-refinements-round-2.md)

- [x] Focus border and padding refinements: Make prompt input focus border 1px, and update padding to 6px all around for prompt input and messages

  - **Status**: Completed - focus border thinned and padding made consistent
  - **Details**: Changed prompt input focus-visible box-shadow from 2px to 1px for more subtle focus indicator. Updated padding to 6px all around for prompt input (was 8px 12px), user messages (was 8px), and assistant messages (was 4px 0). Creates more compact, consistent appearance throughout the interface with better balance between compactness and readability.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/style-refinements-focus-padding.md](docs/todos/style-refinements-focus-padding.md)

- [x] Button spacing and positioning: Reduce spacing between action buttons and prompt input to 4px, and move buttons above input when at bottom of pane

  - **Status**: Completed - button spacing tightened and positioning optimized
  - **Details**: Reduced button spacing from 8px to 4px for tighter layout. Added flex-direction to input-container and used column-reverse for has-messages state, so buttons appear above the textarea when input is at bottom. More ergonomic layout with buttons easily accessible above input field.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/button-spacing-positioning.md](docs/todos/button-spacing-positioning.md)

## App.tsx Refactoring (Oracle Review)

### 1. Remove "thinking" pseudo-message pattern

- [x] Delete logic that injects/removes a special "thinking" message in the messages array
- [x] Create `src/webview/components/ThinkingIndicator.tsx` component
- [x] Add `<ThinkingIndicator when={isThinking()} />` at bottom of message list
- [x] Simplifies message update logic by eliminating repeated filtering and special-case handling

  - **Status**: Completed - thinking indicator extracted to standalone component
  - **Details**: Created ThinkingIndicator component that uses `<Show>` to conditionally render. Removed "thinking" from Message type union. Eliminated all `.filter((m) => m.id !== "thinking")` calls from part-update, message-update, response, and error handlers. Simplified message rendering to remove if/else branching for thinking messages.
  - **Benefits**: ~50 lines of code removed, cleaner message state management, no special-case filtering needed

- [x] Create useVsCodeBridge composable

  - **Status**: Completed - message bridge successfully extracted into reusable hook
  - **Details**: Created `src/webview/hooks/useVsCodeBridge.ts` with callback-based API for all 7 message types (init, agentList, thinking, partUpdate, messageUpdate, response, error). Updated App.tsx to use the hook, removing ~50 lines of direct window message handling code. Exports MessagePart and Agent types for reuse. Returns `send` function for outgoing messages.
  - **Benefits**: Clean separation between transport layer and UI state management, better testability, improved type safety, App.tsx more focused on orchestration
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/useVsCodeBridge.md](docs/todos/useVsCodeBridge.md)

### 3. Extract message update helpers

- [x] Create `src/webview/utils/messageUtils.ts`
- [x] Implement `applyPartUpdate(messages, part)` - handles creating or updating message with streaming parts
- [x] Implement `applyMessageUpdate(messages, incoming)` - handles message create/update with role, text, and parts
- [x] Keep arrays immutable with proper spread operations
- [x] Handle create-or-update idempotently (check if message exists, if not create it)
- [x] Replace inline message update logic in App.tsx with: `setMessages(prev => applyPartUpdate(prev, payload))`
- [x] Benefits: Pure functions, easy to test, safer streaming behavior, no special-case filtering

### 4. Split into focused components

#### InputBar component

- [x] Create `src/webview/components/InputBar.tsx`
- [x] Contains textarea, submit button logic, keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Integrate AgentSwitcher component
- [x] Handle auto-resize logic for textarea (move from App.tsx)
- [x] Props: `value`, `onInput`, `onSubmit`, `disabled`, `selectedAgent`, `agents`, `onAgentChange`

#### AgentSwitcher component

- [x] Move to `src/webview/components/AgentSwitcher.tsx` (already exists but may need refinement)
- [x] Keep current button-only switcher design
- [x] Props: `agents`, `selectedAgent`, `onAgentChange`

#### MessageList component

- [x] Create `src/webview/components/MessageList.tsx`
- [x] Renders messages array using MessageItem components
- [x] Owns auto-scroll behavior with "stick to bottom only if near bottom" logic
- [x] Add bottom sentinel div for scrollIntoView
- [x] Check if user is near bottom (within 40px) before auto-scrolling
- [x] Props: `messages`, `isThinking`

#### MessageItem component

- [x] Create `src/webview/components/MessageItem.tsx`
- [x] Renders a single message with proper styling for user vs assistant
- [x] Delegates part rendering to MessagePartRenderer
- [x] Props: `message`

#### MessagePartRenderer component

- [x] Create `src/webview/components/MessagePartRenderer.tsx`
- [x] Switch on part type and delegate to specific part components
- [x] Props: `part`

#### Message part components

- [x] Create `src/webview/components/parts/TextBlock.tsx` - renders text parts
- [x] Create `src/webview/components/parts/ReasoningBlock.tsx` - renders reasoning blocks
- [x] Create `src/webview/components/parts/ToolCall.tsx` - move current renderToolPart logic here
- [x] Each component is small and presentational

### 5. Create shared types file

- [x] Create `src/webview/types.ts`
- [x] Move Message, MessagePart, ToolState, Agent interfaces
- [x] Create union type for all host→webview message events
- [x] Import in all components and hooks for type safety
- [x] Prevents handler drift between extension and webview

### 6. Simplify App.tsx to orchestration-only

- [x] Keep only state signals (input, messages, isThinking, isReady, agents, selectedAgent)
- [x] Wire useVsCodeBridge with update callbacks using messageUtils helpers
- [x] Compose InputBar and MessageList components
- [x] Remove all direct message handling logic, auto-scroll, textarea resize
- [x] App becomes thin orchestration layer (~120 lines vs previous 226)

### 7. Small cleanups and improvements

- [x] Replace `Date.now().toString()` with `crypto.randomUUID()` for message IDs
- [x] Add `createMemo` for derived values like `hasMessages` and `currentAgent`
- [x] Wrap verbose console.log with debug flag: `const DEBUG = false; if (DEBUG) console.log(...)`
- [x] Ensure applyMessageUpdate never clobbers streaming parts unless incoming.parts is explicitly present
- [x] Add "stick to bottom" guard to prevent scroll jank during streaming

- [x] Session switcher and new session button. I want this to be similar to Amp's setup, which is that the session switcher is all the way at the top, it's a button you can click it, it opens a dropdown which shows the other session titles. I don't know if Opencode SDK supports the session titles, we'll have to research this. To the right of the session switcher is a quiet-style new session button. Collectively, the session switcher and the new session button make up the top bar, and its separated from the message pane with a divider.

  - **Status**: Completed - session switcher fully implemented with dropdown UI, backend integration, and styling
  - **Details**: Created TopBar component with SessionSwitcher (dropdown showing all sessions with titles and timestamps) and NewSessionButton (+ button). Backend fully wired up with OpenCode API session management (list, create, switch). Session titles ARE supported by OpenCode SDK. Top bar separated from messages with border divider. All styled using VSCode theme variables.
  - **Documentation**: See [docs/todos/session-switcher.md](docs/todos/session-switcher.md)
  - **Known Limitations**: No message history loading when switching sessions, session titles not editable, no session deletion, no persistence across reloads, dropdown doesn't close on outside click
  
- [ ] Markdown support in assistant messages
- [ ] @-mention support
- [ ] Better tool calls
